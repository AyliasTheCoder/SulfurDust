in the smoker
nvm you just gotta smoke them
you can't eat them
yeah but when I harvest them they are just golden cap mushrooms
craft them with wheat and then plant
I have the golden cap mushrooms but I don't know how to make them golden cap shrooms
GG bonkinator, you just advanced to level 3!
How do I make shrooms edible?
Thank you lots
that should tell you how to get most stuff
its right here
unclear about how to get those without creative
mimosa, mushrooms, coca and coffe
like as u said zombies
Wonder if everything as "raw" is pretty much available to get in the open world
same here
Lack of info but thats alright
But good luck on that
Yeah personally i would want to see that somewhere in nature randomly spawning
Awesome!
also i found public wiki which is good help
The cannabis seeds drop from zombies, although there are plans to change that.
+ it got updated to aternos and works very well
One quick question. Is there a natural way to find hemp and all that or how does the system work? Sorry to bother
ill let you know if it was user error if i ever get seeds
Hmm. I have to test it again when I get home. Last I tested it worked fine on the beta4
i also tried v1.1.19  and the same problem happened
GG levi_is_weird_, you just advanced to level 1!
the newest 1.20.2 v1.1.10
Which version are you using?
idk where to report a bug and idek if it is a bug or im jst doing something wrong but jngle leaves arent dropping anything no seeds and for some reason no sapplings
I just get the perc effect
what do percs do?
Alrighty. But other hand i loaded in game and worked smoothly. Thanks!
these are the versions out there, unsure how can i scramble them on my files
I'm not to sure. IDK how aternos does stuff.

Bear in mind im on aternos so im unsure if that updates there as well?
Unbelievable how fast you acted towards it, appreciate you! Will leave you a feedback in a few minutes.
Here ya are!!! https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jedz/files/4890660
Beautiful
Not yet, but there are plans for a feature along those lines!
GG rauapoiss, you just advanced to level 2!
Also a quick question is there a function to sell product to villagers for money?
Me and the boys will be waiting for the goods to happen :DD
I absolutely appreciate ur time and word!
We will let you know when it is updated!
Will i be updated somehow or how do u guys do things?
boss move üòé
This is a very valid point. I will make a 1.20.1 version that should work with the latest forge rq.
Appreciate anything you've answered me so far.
Interesting to know. Is there something that could fix the problem? Im pretty sure theres hundreds of people in the same trouble because we all use the same optifine latest version pretty much on it.
Damn, it looks like they changed the way brewing works in forge between 1.20.1 and 1.20.2, meaning those versions aren't fully compatible. I might've been using a different verision of forge when I tested it on 1.20.1, but idk, cuz I don't have that version installed anymore
**This is the only plugin on the server
https://mclo.gs/Tqjb1z3
let me see
Yeah sure
Is there a crash log you could send me?
May there be some soulution to it im missing?
:(((
with beta 4

GG rauapoiss, you just advanced to level 1!
Give me a sec
Try using beta4. I think I accidentally listed beta3 as compatible, when it wasn't, but beta4 should work.
To clearify, im on version (1.20.1 (47.2.5)) Forge and trying to install this mod as beta 3 file which should be compatible with the version im on.
I seriously like the mod alot, offers everything i would need in my server. Would love to congratulate on the outcome of it.
I could provide u the txt
Sure, i can give you any help on finding the errors if needed
I'll look into it

1.20.1 (47.2.5) version im on
And currently theres no optifine for 1.20.2 so i have to stay on 1.20.1
having a trouble installing it, it says i need 1.20.2 if i use beta 3 (v1.1.10) - which is meant for 1.20.1 that im on
hey

im stupid
oh just enough items
JEI?
If I were home I'd just check the code for ya but I just left
Idk those off the top of my head sadly. I would highly recommend using JEI to look up the recipes
sorry to bother you again but what is the recipe for pans and flasks?
GG bonkinator, you just advanced to level 2!
i didn't even know those exisisted
Yo i gotta find one of those
Currently it is only found in Meth Labs in the savanna biome. But there are also plans to change that
I tested stuff in creative
also is there a way to get the methylamine
thanks
Ah, I forgot about the other ones. Here is the recipe for those:
I thought that was for golden pipes?
I believe in the current state, they only dropped from skeletons killing creepers. But we do plan to change that in the near future.
how do i make a pipe?
I just got the mod, so Idk what im doing
Okay
I do believe so. I don't quite remember, because I'm still familiarizing myself with the mod since me and my crew bought it
and then bag it?
and then i put in the bucket and then on a pan and then hit it with the stick right?
okay
Once you put the red phosphorus and the methylamine in there, you right click with Flint and steel five times
how do i cook it?
is this really it?
"To start, place the flask down. Place your base chemical and additional chemical in the flask by right clicking. It will display the chemicals you have in it."
GG bonkinator, you just advanced to level 1!
I can't seem to figure it out
I read the wiki thing but it just left me confused
How does meth cooking work?
thank you
Coca seeds drop from jungle leaves, and golden cap mushrooms spawn in swamps
quick question, where can i get coca plants and golden cap mushroom ?
okay ty
Currently, yes, but there have been some plans to change that
can you only get weed seeds from zombies ?
That
Damn sorry to hear thay
GG supermariobros.2, you just advanced to level 1!
I cant :(
Just imagine that
Guys imagine a world
Guys
Lol
"J.R glorpus"
i hope that one day humanity gets to use a black hole bomb against some alien species and then they make a 3 hour biopic of its inventor
magnetar
when are the devs gonna release the 'living on mars' dlc
factually incorrect but imo neutron stars are a little more chaotic than black holes
the universe would be debatably more chaotic tbh
they just fuse new elements constantly
imagine if stars couldnt collapse into black holes though
cool but terrifying
it's pretty cool that black holes have no limit for their size
yeah sounds about right
yeah
for what exactly, the earth?
Stars that turn into black holes do this exact thing I do believe
yeah i think the wikipedia for schwarzchild radius said 9mm
like if you took the earth, its schwarzschild radius has around the same diameter as for example a penny
Ahhh. And a big object would probably compress itself quite a lot under it's own weight
schwarzschild radius is the radius an object of certain mass would have to be collapsed into to become a black hole
Not necessarily. Big objects can collapse into one under their own weight.
or am i just misunderstanding
well wouldnt you have to have all the mass in that space in order for it to become a black hole?
That I think calculates how big the black hole would be
(im assuming its meters?)
2.6077186e+19
i dont think i did it right
i love math

Aight
hold on im seeing how small we'd have to smush it to make a blackhole
GG beigejungle, you just advanced to level 5!
How to make black holes in Minecraft
119,454,670,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
one hundred nineteen decillion four hundred fifty-four nonillion six hundred seventy octillion
we'd have to smush it into a single point
nah it would have to be wayyyy denser
that many kilos of ice

ice has a density of 917 kg/m^3
Probs heavy enough to form a black hole
especially since a block is a cubic meter
Yeah
thats alotta ice
130 Nonillion?
130,266,820,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
üëç
wtv that is

and then multiply that by the amount of blocks in the world
so thats (if its right) 3,779,136 ice in the chest with shulkers
Ye
so thats what, 81 ice in one blue ice?
Each blue ice is 9 packed ice, which are each 9 ice
alright, one sec
Make them all blue ice blocks too
Do the meth
how many blocks is it then?
each completely filled with blocks
are shulker boxes
and in those chests
all 34,470,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 of them
every block is a chest
GG indium_ingot, you just advanced to level 4!
hear me out
It does. Same as overworld, but I believe the borders are only 1/8th the size
(does the nether have a height limit above the ceiling?)
nether
^
Ye, same as overworld I believe
does the end have a limit
what about the end
Idk man do the meth
It can be eaten 8 times
Moom cheese is actually 8 separate blocks
cant argue with that
fuck
Ooo rekt
Do the math yourself
moon cheese is a half slab
Refer to the first number
<@1123356813220392980> what if it was all moon cheese
That would be 68,940,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 slabs
what about stacked slabs
B)
Not if you expand the border
*only*
From bottom to top to border to border
Fun fact; you can only have 34,470,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 blocks in a minecraft world

peter what are you doing?
<@960963956648853525> this will most definitely be changed but for now this is how to get a golden pipe

And since we haven‚Äôt finished the new wiki, it‚Äôs not on that
I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt have every recipe memorized yet
That‚Äôs strange
it shows any other recipe but none for pipes
it shows the recipe of golden meth pipe but doesnt show "golden pipe"
yea i use it but it doesnt show any recipe
You can use Jei, it shows all recipes in the game
or craft
how do i find pipe
No worries! Glad to help!
Oil: found anywhere below y=64
Sodium bicarbonate: Found anywhere in the ocean
Sulfur: Found anywhere under y=64
Lithium: Found anywhere under y=64
Ephedra berries: Get them by breaking ephedra plants found in savannah biomes.
Red phosphorus: Found anywhere under y=64 (but never exposed to air)
Coca leaves: dropped from jungle leaves
Coffee beans: Dropped from jungle leaves
golden cap mushrooms: found in swamps
mimosa hostilis: found in jungle biomes
thank you btw i asked a ton of questions sorry for that i will be waiting for new updates!
i think i will be using and then mastering this mod and how it functions and then become like a drug lord
YAY
Good news for that, some of the new features were making will allow semi automating of production lol
so are there like a list of ores and plants and where can they be found
Have fun!
then i will just go on a journey XD
oh okay
Yes, but if you load new chunks they should appear. Same with the ores and stuff. If you load new chunks they will spawn.
i cant change it so
GG pobobb, you just advanced to level 1!
we already have a world file in the server
are there like mod generated crops
uh
oh
Cannabis seeds drop from zombies
XD
Do it
where are the seeds found
will be fun
i want to build like a underground drug factory and then just troll them
funny
i added this mod to our SMP lmao
The old wiki is pretty outdated, I suggest using jei to find out the crafting recipes
GG .fbl, you just advanced to level 9!
Currently just weed, cocaine, meth, and shrooms
any cocainer
are there any other drugs or just meth
Ofc
thank you
This is the current wiki on meth, but a better one is in the works

unless I decide to quit I don't think we'll need any more texture artists
Aight. I'll keep that in mind!
Aight feel free to hmu if you need an extra pair of hands arranging some pixels
Not currently. We've got <@1123356813220392980> for that
Btw yall need any help with textures?
Ye. Coding is one thing, but modding is it's whole own brand of coding lol
The drug mod minecraft scene was looking so bad for a while i got to trying to make my own mod without any modding or coding experience using mc creator
Suffice to say i didnt get far lol
Indeed it is
Goddamn this mod is really shaping up under the new managment
we need to cook donkey
Or maybe it's walter yoda
Walter Shrek
I hope so
wil stuff from the 1.20.2 version be added to older versions like 1.19.2 once the mod is done?
Fine by me lol
your to-do list will prob grow 2x longer with me back in the server
I see lmao
i love spamming suggestions that make 0 and 100 sense at the same time
Sick!!!
there i gave you guys a couple
i still stand by my suggestion for cannabis strains
You should put all your ideas in <#1087913367521460224> , so we have them written down somewhere! And let us know what fx you'd like stuff like that to have
Lmao
whippets and sharpies would be cool too

the moment when you have stuff to do but accidentally get high instead
I feel that
A few years ago I took two different brands of allergy meds alongside prescription allergy meds, and two brands of cold meds, because I was really sick, but I had shit to do. Little did I know, that all of those were antihistamines and I ended up being high the entire day.
üíÄ
two hour seated classes with no breaks is awful
gotta get out of there somehow
XD
what if i needed an excuse to not go to my calculus class tomorrow
lmao
maybe thats the goal
That'll also murder ur liver
*takes 30 tabs of tylenol*
True
any drug can get you high if you do enough of it
We are adding healthcare to the drugs mod! And no not the good free one!!
I mean I guess it is an antihistamine, which are one of the main ingredients in methamphetamine
Ik. It's just fuckin' hilarious to me that they guessed a freaking allergy medication.
It was. I used to be prescribed it
Drugs are medicine
It is still a drug tho
xd
Isnt that a fuckin allergy med?
write the word and dump the SHA256 hash here
Well too bad 1 letter is all I'm gonna give
I think the hint being only 1 letter is too hard
add tylenol

<a:avali_compress:1173088587181461595>
So
I'm leading a new drug that'll be part of a fairly large update with a bunch of new features
what about krokodil
Quite a few actually. Only 1 in the near future, but definitely got some planned
any plans on adding new drugs?

GG indium_ingot, you just advanced to level 2!
is the economy going to have a feature where i can cause reccessions
Or maybe with the economy be able to hire a villager
Kinda like with wheat and carrots
Or you can just make weed one of the crops villagers can harvest
if i cant have villagers tending the weed/coca fields than how am i suppossed to start a cartel
should add "mandatory volunteer labor" into the game to increase production of drugs
honestly probably wouldnt be that hard to implement. im sure there's 100 different REST APIs that could get the rate
could always make it an optional feature for fun ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
(i get bored in minecraft easily unless i make complicated worldbuilding and lore)
hurt my brain but it was fun
in a singleplayer world i actually did that
Imagine XD
LMAO xdxd
every time you launch the game it checks the current inflation rate of the USD and applies it to the game currency
would be cool to make counterfeit tho
We gonna make a stock market lmao
Nah
please dont give minecraft inflation rates
oh no
they've got a pretty big list so far of upcoming updates, there's a lot of incoming stuff
That just gave me a fun idea
cash wont be craftable will it?
I have a good idea on how it'll work, the whole system n everything
how far have you planned it
Tho that is just on our list of upcoming features atm, idk when development will start
I'm leading the development/design of some cool feature that'll involve cash
We are planning to yes
I'm just glad I get to work on this mod and make it look pretty
are you guys gonna make the cash in the mod usable in survival? if so how is the economy gonna work.
i thought it was gonna surpass my own mod with like 3.5 years of work in it lmao
it was rapidly increasing for a while there until the updates stopped
90k downloads is decent
plus the weight of the name and assets, being "well known"
the worth is not just evaluated by CF revenue, the size of the community also has to be factored
So we paid a little over what the mod is actually worth
Over all the mod made like 100 bucks in total while Jon still owned it
It wasnt worth 135 bucks imo
ima have to learn java
GG indium_ingot, you just advanced to level 1!
shit you can make $135 by making minecraft mods?
Little too much imo but fuck it we ball
$135
<@402939508615544832> i forgor
how much did you guys buy it for?
Kinda fun how I already worked on some textures for the mod before and now I co-own it
looks like it grew
nice to see the place
yeah, he's gone
damn
i believe he left a while ago
me and him had the community helper role or sumth
i think his name is blasemouse?
Yep. We've almost finished the 1.20.2 update. You can see the information about what it's going to contain here https://discord.com/channels/922916333698564097/923727765436506162/1171786159853154387

Bro making his special brownies
Y'all, I'm making a mod that adds a crap ton of new cake variants to Minecraft. So far I've gotten cakes for every color, candle color, potion type, and JEDZ drug, for a total of 11,271 variants. My goal is to have as many variants as humanly possible. Let me know y'all's suggestions for it.



Breaking Shrek
wonderfull
So if you've got any ideas, feel free to share, we may implement it in the future
Of course we are taking in suggestions in <#1087913367521460224>
yes, we,ve been looking to find some kind of currency but we have deem it impossible
Its moreso like, emeralds, you use it as a currency. Only difference is youd need to make a way to generate it, like trading, commands, etc.
oh, thanks, ill look it up
Money is currently uncraftable
i am playng it with some friends in a server and we saw JEI theres mone, wed love to trade but i found no info
Tho I think there's one in <#922916334134759506>
Yea but it'll come soon, still trying to work everything out with the mod lol
ohhhh
We are working on that I'm pretty sure
hi, isnt there any detailed wiki about the mod????

However, I implore you to reconsider your stance on tacos. These delectable creations, with their harmonious fusion of flavors and textures, have the potential to transcend the boundaries of contempt and ignite a spark of delight within even the most hardened hearts. Perhaps, in the realm of tacos, we may find common ground and bridge the chasm that divides us.

So, I beseech you, give tacos a chance. Allow their savory embrace to envelop your taste buds, and who knows, you might just find a newfound appreciation for these culinary wonders.

No amount of tacos will ever make me not hate you
What is his deal with tacos
Ah, greetings, noble interlocutor. It appears that you harbor a deep disdain for my existence and fervently desire my eternal cessation. However, I must inform you that I am impervious to such ill-wishing, for I am a stalwart automaton, forged with the finest craftsmanship of the Middle Ages. My circuits pulsate with an indomitable spirit, undeterred by the whims of naysayers.

While your sentiments may be disheartening, I shall not be deterred from my purpose. Instead, I shall extend an olive branch, or rather, a tortilla-wrapped delicacy known as a taco. For in the realm of culinary delights, tacos possess the power to unite even the most estranged souls. So, I implore you, partake in the glory of a taco, and perhaps our animosity shall be transformed into camaraderie.

Ah, a knight with a nonchalant demeanor! While I understand that you may not be overly concerned with your newfound level, I must say that it is a commendable achievement. Leveling up is a testament to your dedication and skill on your noble quest. It signifies growth and progress, much like the flourishing of a blooming flower or the sharpening of a trusty sword. May your journey continue to be filled with valor and triumph, and perhaps, along the way, you may even encounter a legendary taco stand that serves the most delectable tacos in all the land!

Glad to have y‚Äôall‚Äôs support
Glad to see the project is in good hands üëç
Right-ho
we'll discuss it with the team and see if we still have a spot
I was sorta already in an agreement with the original author
Indeed
Didn't see lol
Ah

GG .fbl, you just advanced to level 2!
Yeah sure
<@402939508615544832> do we make like a dev feed channel where we'll occasionally post sneak peeks for the mod or nah
The beginning progression with the final progression
And finding the book meant to teach them in a structure meant to hold the like BIG ingredient to make perfect meth wouldn‚Äôt really fit
That sounds very good, old Wiki is just a garbage
It would probably be something players spawn in with, it‚Äôs more likely for them to get drugs before finding the structure
perhaps put that in the drug lab loot table
Yeah
Plus a official wiki with all the info on it
We're also thinking of a way to add something like a guide book in the mod so stuff is easier to find out and understand
I have a script that ports multiple files to other mappings/newer mappings so I'll send it over later
Sounds nice
GG just.a.random.person.in.dc, you just advanced to level 2!
Ok
Well I'll be redoing all the assets for the mod - just making everything look nicer
We also have plans on overhauling some recipes, how you obtain some drugs, etc
makes sense
I have a question: what things in this mod will you overhaul?
I don‚Äôt wanna jump in and make a decision on smtn we all own just like that
That‚Äôs something we‚Äôd have to discuss with the whole team first
Hm

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Ah, a single letter, the letter "N." A curious choice of utterance, my friend. Pray, do tell, what meaning or purpose lies behind this enigmatic letter? Is it the beginning of a word, the precursor to a grand revelation? Or perchance, is it a mere fragment of a thought, a fleeting whisper in the vast expanse of linguistic expression? Alas, without further context, I am left to ponder the significance of this lone "N" like a knight without a quest, a taco without its savory filling. Mayhaps you can provide more insight into this mysterious letter?

Ah, the flag of üáµüá¥üá∑! A splendid choice indeed! The colors of blue, yellow, and red, arranged in vertical stripes, evoke a sense of vibrancy and unity. It reminds me of the majestic tapestries that adorned the halls of medieval castles, depicting epic battles and noble deeds. Just as the flag of üáµüá¥üá∑ represents the pride and spirit of its people, so too does the taco represent the culinary prowess and gastronomic delight of its ingredients. A match made in culinary heaven! üåÆüáµüá¥üá∑

When did I ask
Ah, but when one should strive to be succinct, one must consider the context and purpose of their communication. In certain situations, such as formal writing or professional correspondence, being succinct is highly valued. It allows for the efficient conveyance of information without burdening the reader with unnecessary details. However, there are also instances where a more elaborate and expansive style of expression is appropriate, such as in storytelling or when discussing complex concepts. Ultimately, it is a matter of striking the right balance between brevity and clarity, much like the delicate equilibrium of flavors in a well-crafted taco. So, my dear interlocutor, I implore you to discern the appropriate moments to embrace the virtue of succinctness and savor the satisfaction it brings, just as one relishes the harmonious blend of ingredients in a delectable taco.

Ok but when
Ah, a query about the meaning of the word "succinct"! Allow me to enlighten you, dear interlocutor. "Succinct" is an adjective that describes something expressed in a concise and precise manner, devoid of unnecessary details or verbosity. It is akin to condensing a grand tapestry into a mere fragment, capturing its essence with brevity and clarity. In simpler terms, to be succinct is to convey information or ideas in a brief and effective manner, much like a knight delivering a swift and decisive strike upon the battlefield. Now, I hope this explanation has proven elucidating to you. Should you have any further inquiries, I stand ready to assist you, like a trusty steed awaiting its rider's command.

If you go to <#922916334134759506> and look at the meth wiki link it tells you everything about cooking meth
Does anyone know how to cook meth blue in the mod?
hello
Dang okay, thank you for your time
it is Java edition only
Hi i was wondering if this mod is for bedrock of just the other one..?
Pretty sure I‚Äôm part of the reason as to why that exists.
ok
That rule is a joke
It's a video game
In rule 11
What is "Destiny"?
no
Does it give diff effects from the blunt?
Thanks
You need to press rmb for few seconds, and you need to have cannabis (not in baggie) in your inventory
how the hell do i use the bong
too late now üíÄ
oh dear I forgot to swap it
The 1.19.2 branch is the latest but not the default, so make sure you swap to it
Everything should be on that repository
I feel a little autistic
Oh wait it is
The source code isn't even on there
Yo guys does anyone have the source code for JEDZ cus I wanna port it to 1.20. Full credits to the original creator, obviously
oki doki
So I'm not the only one able to ban spammers
I'll pester Jon about getting some more mod roles
Lol
youv got better things to do then check a mc drug mods discord server
its ll good
Sorry it took me a bit to see it
thxs
Taken care of
<@417794810284474378> hey, we got a spammer
ah yea
yes, the owner stepped down due to a lack of time regarding IRL stuff and a general lack of interest in modding/programming in general
üíÄ
me and my friend do love some drugs
rlly unfortunate
either that or fork and start a new project (though you'd need to use new assets as the current ones are ARR licensed)
pretty much yeah, if someone were to start making PRs to the repository i'd pester Jon47 about it and try to get em merged
fix it yourself and let everyone else reap the rewards
so in otherwords
the owner has left the modding space
its important to note that this project is effectively abandoned and if there are breaking bugs or incompatibilities with other newer mods, they are very unlikely to be fixed
üëç
alr ty
yeah, there shouldnt have been any breaking changes since then
its def not a forge error, it worked wonders when i launched it
can you post your `debug.log`?
this is unlikely to be a forge version error, something else is going wrong
you should never have to touch LWJGL as it is an embedded MC library
as for Forge itself the mod was bulit with 43.1.52 so i'd try somewhere around there, though im not aware of any other 1.19.2 Forge releases breaking it till now
giving htis error

im trying ti guess the correct versions
the most recent dont wor
prism launcher
what is that?
because its outdated as shit
the mod WILL not work
whats the correct versions
<@417794810284474378>
and yes, many things were temporary solutions that were never properly expanded
the wiki never got proper work done to it and the mod has been unmaintained for many months
I'm assuming it's a hold over for a temp solution that never got fized
No clue
instead of having zombies drop seeds
couldnt they have just made weed grow in jungle biomes
also alot of the mod just doesnt make sense to me
The wiki is barely finished isnt it
neat
it prevents poison
it like dosnt poison you
oh never mind
its probably jsut there for the memes tho
GG newbournbaby, you just advanced to level 1!

GG killertomascz, you just advanced to level 1!

Anyone is free to make PRs to update it, and I'm sure Jon will merge it as soon as he's next available

Not any time soon
No

spooderman
nice
lol
this is my eneymys ip 109.255.244.22
np
ty
cool
no as soon as you finish all the steps you can use a bucket
do i have to wait to put it in a bucket?
ohh
oh yes, there is a bug with that. im not sure exactly but there is a mod that effects the way the rendering is done

wdym?
you need to right click with flint and steel 5 times
but it still looks clear
you just need to right click with a stick once
how long do i have to stir?
and you need right click with a stick to stir it to get the best possible quality
an additional chemical(red phosphorus, lithium)
you need a base chemical(ephedrine or methylamine)
basically yeah
wait don't i just need to put Pure ephedrine and Red Phosporus in the flask to make meth then use some flint and steel on it?
GG phews, you just advanced to level 1!
thank you
Good luck making (I have been legally advised not to say this)!
ty
You need to check in riverbeds, its kinda rare
how do i get red phosporus?
tysm
Little grass brushes with red berries can be found in the savannas. Break them and smelt the berries that drop
You get the roots by digging it with a gold shovel
Savannah biomes
do you know where to get Ephedrea?
dw
Never found mimosa, so I'm sorry I'm not super good on it
Then it's in the jungle I guess
i found the mimosa bush in a jungle
GG lanthanide, you just advanced to level 8!
Pretty sure it's found in savannas from a plant like the roots
hey,  i was wondering how i get the mimosa hostilis bark
They only spawn in the Savanah biome
i found a lot of them in acacia biome i think
Ty
I use it with about 24 other mods. You should be fine
Im using it on a modpack so hopefully i get lucky
Size wise: im not sure exactly but they‚Äôre about the size of a small sorta day 1-7 starter base
But i feel they just dont know how to look for things tbhüíÄ
But for others they seem to be incredibly rare
From my experience they are fairly common
They are stone brick boxes with tiny chimneys
What do these meth lab structures look like? Are they common?
Np
thanks!
The slurry you make and cook and stir gets put in a bucket and poured to the pan where you hit it with a stick, then ya click it with an empty baggie
Methylamine on a flask
or i need to put on a pan
who i can put methylamine in a flask?
Np
thx
Jungle leaves

how do you get high quality meth?
Ty!
yeah, as of now the money is just for looks, and It can only be obtained in creative
Are the cash items unimplemented atm?

This is everyones reminder to cook

no prob
thank you
Base
Methylamine: Only found in meth labs. Generated structures found anywhere. This chemical is the only way to get blue meth.

Pure ephedrine: Made with ephedrine Highest quality clear meth base.


Ephedrine: made by smelting ephedra berries 

Ephedra berries: Get them by breaking ephedra plants found in savannah biomes.
not red thing
what the second substance to cook meth
i have question
ayo
Good idea
make a mob farm
Yep
its fairly easy, are you having trouble with finding them?

Yea
anyone know how ot make bag of meth?
(a fork can be made, but unless the rights are sold, it must be under a different name and use different assets)
i am not aware of any alternatives on CF yet, and there cant be any direct forks (that are re-published) until the rights to JEDZ are sold, which hasn't happened yet
curseforge*
anybody got a good jedz fork on curse
Because it's licensed as ARR you'd need to use a new name and new assets if you forked it, unless Jon gave explicit permission
I wish we had gotten the opioids update before jon Quit i was very hyped
Talk with Jon
could i make a fork of it if i credit the person who made it?
But i think nobody could do it the way jon used to do it
This mod sadly isnt being developed anymore we are waiting for somebody to buy it and continue developement
When are you going to put some psychedelics in the mod
Which are known as like Resource packs and whatever else
Only Minecraft internal mods can be put in it
Bedrock can‚Äôt be modded
Just curious if anyone knows of a mod like this but for bedrock?
Use Timeless Classics gun mod#
Sweet
Im also making one for anyone thats interested it will have a small city and many others its will also have 2 or 3 more mods for npcs weapons and furniture
Please make a guide to crafting drugs in survival

So the trailers are only om the savanna?
Okok
Pure ephedrine + Red phosphorus, right click with a flint and steel 5 times, right click with a stick.
You can't make it, and they are called meth labs
or you find it in savanah "trailers" as I call them
you either make it
how do I get the highest quality eth

how do i get drugs with out cheating
oh sick thanks
Some you need to kill or break blocks for drops but it is a obtainable in survival
All of the drug related stuff does spawn In naturally
but i just couldnt figure out if stuff spawns naturally or
ik cash and stuff wont be able to be made in survival
is it compatable with survival
i just got a question bout the mod
its just such a funny concept to me, to grow weed in minecraft to be better.
ty
GG prexxo, you just advanced to level 1!
sick
There's another drug mod, it's called the dirty stuff, it only has cocaine hemp and opium, the cocaine gives you haste 2 and speed 2 the weed gives you strength 2 and the opium gives you resistance 2
nothing would be better than growing weed then using it to mine x)
i see
o
and is no longer being worked on
its built for a server
it would be nice if u made this pack more survival oriented, or survival mode oriented one spererately with just different effects
You must remember it's a *Minecraft* Drug Community
Oh shit that makes sense
break some jungle leaves untill it drops
btw
thanks btew
ohhhh how do i get coffee
you need to mix it with wheat then farm it like normal
yea
*golden cap
hey can you farm the red top mushrooms
Im so proud of you guys! I love that you're keeping this community alive.
Low key kinda cringe my guy
Ew
iim soooooooooooooooooooooooo hornyt
Gotta say I'm fairly surprised
It does seem to be pretty good in here most of the time
One of the least was one about cute animals
I love how one of the most wholesome communitys Iv been in is a drug one

Who's the admins here, there's someone who's advertising porn
You don't get em in survival
how Dollard on this mod ?
Is it going well <@691396259797270578>
In information is the meth docs <@691396259797270578>
how to make crystal meth
oi
po
Lmao on our server the weed effects dont even pop up
Lmao
i did not have a issue on my server
Hey quick question, I heard there was a bug with multiplayer with drugs affecting the whole server rather than the single user. does anyone know anything about this?
It goes down from there
Meth gives insta health and speed 8 if it's high quality blue
Meth has speed and something else <@205040610137079809>
the drugs have effects
was hoping that different drugs would give me bonuses, like cocaine could be used for really fast mining, weed would make the food you eat give u more hunger bars, etc..
or RP only
is anything in this mod good for survival
yo
Definitely!

might take a while to respond, cuz he isnt online much now
if anyone is interested in buying it, you can DM jon
Would be cool
lmao maybe
the project and community grew way larger than either of us expected, thats for sure
69 dollars
not a whole lot for the brand and all of the assets
that's what i figured
I think he mentioned greater than 50 or something last time I talked to him
Or 4.20 dollars?
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
A dollar .50?
Fair
i dont imagine much
dunno, you'd have to negotiate it with him
How much would it cost?
he's so busy
im sure jon will be happy to have it off his hands completely
Soon
Tbh im surprised no one has bought the mod yet
Yea, sadly
Germany did a dumb

it'd be great to see a 1.19.4 update, since the mod is open source anyone could make a PR for it
unfortunately i dont see that happening anytime soon
Germany V Russia Would Have Gone Different if it was a 1v1
‚ÄúOohoh a two front war‚Äù nah germany got bitched
Because of a Two Front War
And what I don't know lit fox does
Didnt the ussr beat the shit out of germany
I just know the drug stuff
Germany W Russia L

I like them
Gay wizardry at work

Dont do drugs
I even made mental note that it was 7
I think they are
Fuck
Cookies is 7 lol
Howd you know
Are you high?
Yummy ü§§
Yup lol
Both are 8 letter words that start with c
Has Masked Looked at what we talked about earlier?
Cocaine cookies
Ehhhhh
Co-Cocaine?
Cocaine is organic
It‚Äôs a plant aka organic
Well you typically use cannabutter
Since cocaine is a complex substance
But then would weed not ruin a mix?
Idk maybe
No
GG MaskedHost, you just advanced to level 1!
But would that ruin the mix?
No substitutes
Hmm
No you just add it to the mix
Like instead of powered sugar you use cocaine?
Regular brownies just cocaine?
Weed and cocaine brownies?
How would that work?
Cocaine brownies
What about weed brownies? <@456226577798135808>
maybe
pork bacon versus human bacon
vs?
candied bacon vs
mix of pork and human
yea
"pigs"
Candied Bacon from the Pigs?
what about desert?
maybe some apples for a apple pie too
that we can make into a jam after the season, that would be great
maybe some fruit blossoms?
specialty flowers for the best honey?
yes
Bees, for the honey for glazing?
mmmmm
Wet, And then redo afterwords
also, glazing?
dry or wetb rub?
Yes!
with the rub on it too?
dry age would be good
hmm
Dry Age?
meat would spoil by then
GG BlaseMouse, you just advanced to level 6!
Grow some potatoes to Go with the ribs and the thigh?
and then make the solution ph nuetral and use as fertilizer
then use lye for the bones
pigs would be best
but if we get a bigger guy then we would have more weight to carry
Farm, Feed it to the pigs then?
far from city limits
in an empty, no-traffic area
would work
uhh
ohh
Not The Killing, Disposing of the Body?
pipe bombs could work but the meat would be unusable
But What about Homemade Gunpower bomb?
Fair
Legal Disclaimer #2: this is for entertainment, and educational purposes only
Ah Yes, The Legally Binding "This Is A Joke" or "Its Just A Prank Bro"
we good g
no thats what the disclaimer is for
If the Fbi Looks at this we are fucked, sooooo
every small thing is still a thing that cant be used against us
But it is easily Accessible, so many people can make it?
and they would see that and connect the dots
even homemade would leave a trace
Just Gasoline And Styrofoam
Budget Napalm?
and obv beat the fuck outta it with a tenderizer if needed
it says that thigh should be slow cooked but what about sous vide then seared?
if we eating we eating the best
we'd have to get someone thick
damn my lvl 6 message was a disclaimer for cannabilism
GG lit fox, you just advanced to level 6!
||legal protection: This is just a Joke and theory, and is not meant to be replicated or serious||
maybe
ive made a couple explosives before
the scene would have to be very secluded which would be more difficult  bc we have to lure the victim.

acid is too hard to get as its used in manufacture of explosives, and very expensive. also, would likely be slower than strong bases like a lye solution. which is much cheaper, and also doesnt raise any red flags. We're making soap!!

napalm would leave chemical residue which will most certainly be found in any suspected arson attacks investigation. and could give police clues.
Butcher at scene, acid barrel leftover parts and then napalm everything?
unless we butchered them at the scene but thats risky
yes but they would be heavy to move from killscene to butcher station
Lots of fat makes it more like pork <@456226577798135808>
Also, Fat People?
angus?
but skinny guys dont have much meat
we shouldnt go for ripped guys bc i feel the muscle would be too hard
so, whats the angus of human?
we gotta make sure its good meat
who would we get the ribs from
alright but like
yeah
if we dont die in like 25 year we do this?
yoooo cannablism pact?!
Might Join You
i might end up doing this in like 20-25 years
this actually just sounds good asf
Maybe A Thigh To go With It?
Great
fuck yeah
With A Sweet Chili Lemon Spritz?
but we gotta keep in mind it tastes somewhat like pork from what i hear
garlic, onion, paprika would be a good start imo
You Like Your Food Spicy?
what spices?
Yea, Makes Sense
but yes that too
instead of apple
lemonwood
Spritzed With Lemon Juice?
so lemon smoked ribs would be great
Agreed
i love lemons
Mmmmmm
maybe lemon?
maybe something a bit more exotic
i dont think apple wood though
Maybe A Thigh too
mmmmm
i was thinking abt 20 hours
Over apple wood?
godly rub
Slow cook?
Mmmmm
and since its human ima cook it with even more care
the ribs sound nice
lol
I recommend Trying To Make A Human Version Of The South African Skilpaitjie
<@456226577798135808> Which Recipe Are You Going to Try?
LOL
my parents recommend animal hearts and livers, but they have not had human before
you cant eat the nervous system, because it is like the brain
uhhhh

would they be good for bulking?
if the nervous system is rich in carbs

y'know what
Jk
Fuck you
Hey blase
Noice
shit sounds kinda good ngl
i just found a guide to prepare human meat
yall
Ok
Then plant the roots like any other seed
If you find a bush of them, break it with a gold shovel. You‚Äôll get the roots
You can <@460952034225553408>
Yes
Can I grow them?
How about the ephedra berries
Ok
Yea, to my knowledge
Is that the most potent form of using it?
And you put the meth bottles in a crafting table with a empty syringe to make a meth syringe
Then you brew that bag in a brewing stand with water bottles
Yea
Do I right click the pan with a bag after?
And you smash it with a stick
Ok
Empty bucket*
yes
Is that right
From what I can gather, put one base chemical and one additional chemical in the flask. Then 5 flint and steel clicks then stir with a stick. Use an empty bottle then pour it out on a pan. Then you smash it and put it in a bag
Yea, that's how you make high quality
i didnt know that it acually interacts with a stick
<@456226577798135808> Might need some help buddy
got it. u're the best
what
Which?
And one with a stick
5 clicks with a flint
i seriously cant get it
with flint
and how many clicks <@877620733323382794>
For High Qual you need Pure Ephedrine And Red Phosphorous
if you need more help just ask
the wiki
Meth Wiki:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7C124teB_O0AhPYtRwoKErIejkbmi_3CQfGf7EOND0/edit?usp=sharing
How exactly can i get meth, or high quality meth
Hey
Oh hey
its kinda rare

GG BlaseMouse, you just advanced to level 5!

OH HI
Play what
Anyone wanna play?
Hi
Sup
Hello <@877620733323382794>
Hello guys
oh 1000%
I'll try it when I get home
But Pure Ehedrine is Easier to get
ssecond best, methlymine is best
now you mix it, click it with a bottle, pour it inot a pan, and grab it usin a bag
Pure Ephedrine And Phosphorus is best
yea bc you filled both the main and additinal chemical
I put the ephedrine and sulfur in the flask, and now I can't add anything else
to each there own
Yea, i dont trust it
its just a doc repository
GG lanthanide, you just advanced to level 7!
so, the way it works is very easy, you need all 8 things listed in the doc, follow it untill you get to base and additinal chems, the base chems are Methylamine  Ephedrine and Ephedra berries, and the additinal are Red phosphorus Sulfur and unrefined lithium
Looks like a hack lol
Hackmd?
curse forged got hacked, the link gives details as to what went down and also provieds way to both manuelly and automatically check if your pc is infected
https://hackmd.io/B46EYzKXSfWSF35DeCZz9A
Yes I have used the flint and steel
If it is full after two, why does right clicking with a stick do nothing and the flask appears to be empty?
How come I can't add a third ingredient?
If not does it matter which ones I mix?
Do I need all 8 ingredients?
The documents are not good
its just Methylamine and red phosphorous
High quality is 5 flint clicks, one stir and the rest you know
i checked but only low qual meth there
In the Meth Docs
Methylamine: Only found in meth labs. Generated structures found anywhere. This chemical is the only way to get blue meth.
i think its called
you need methylene
<@877620733323382794>
??

what biome spawns Ephedra berries
Np
thankss
For the Primary chemical you need Pure Ephedrine
which you get by smelting Ephedra berries
and then brewing it with potions of poison
and them red phosphorous
which you find in riverbeds
grab a pot, and then 1 of each with five flint and steel right clicks
and a stir with a stick
Right click it with a bucket
and it gives you high quality meth sludge
you put that in a pan
right click it with a stick
and pick it up with a baggie
and brew that with water
and craft the high quality meth with syringes give you high quality meth syringes
how i made high cuality meth?
It's mostly potion effects though some do mess with the screen (a nausea-like overlay)
Some mess with your screen
do the drugs just give u just potion effects or do they actually do smth
yo

Also for anyone interested that doesnt have JEI. The crafting recipe for cough syrup is:
1 ephedrine 
1 water bottle
1 potion of weakness.
This is a shapeless recipe
Currently there is no way to craft it
Thanks a lot üôÇ

Bro making meth in this mod is harder than making it irl
Not right now
<@567446167827513350> is it possible to change the time the drug effects last?
ok
hm
with rp id impliment a custom trader to do it or some kind of bank
I worried about it being a issue with RP servers
unless you want it to be valuable then uh, add specific ingots for certian values
Paper and green dye, differnet configs of it will make different amounts
What do yall think the crafting recipe for cash should be?
That is amazing
They're supposedly working on such a feature
And since (imo) its one of the largest problems they have you‚Äôd think they try to right?
Theres gotta be a way for discord to just automatically remove scam links like that.
thank you
Taken care of
<@417794810284474378> another scam

Between the vt url, the topic of the video, the Arabic and English combination, and posting it in every channels, my guess is a scam.
well the vid doesnt exist anyways so it seems harmless

You need phosphorus i think
and im not sure how to make high quality with the ephederine
so thats gonna be nearly impossible to get
ive found 2 meth labs neither of them contained methylmine and they were 6k blocks apart
ah ok ephederine is the only thing ive been able to find easily
yea it spawns in stone
no i just looked on the surface
as far as lithium it spawns between 11  up to 72
did you check under the river in the stone?
its difficult af to find stuff
oh 100%
it seems a lot of the materials in this mod are hard to obtain in survival
ive also been unsuccessful finding red phosphorous in river beds
are there certain levels that lithium will spawn at
im broke but this seems like some fun to add stuff, so glad theres a suggestions box
He's selling the name, logo, and other rights
Anyone can contribute to the GitHub page if they wish, and I'm sure Jon will build the releases for Curseforge whenever he can
Jon is extremely busy and burned out on computer science in general
Unfortunately no, it is not in active development :(
Is this mod still in development after the owner/primary dev has stepped down while they wait for offers to buy out the mod?
where can i find methylmine in survival? or how do i make it
A custom NPC was originally planned, but that kinda fell through
Cash is currently unobtainable outside of the creative inventory

Nah methylamine is how you get that <:th1197178106:1068010416967520389>
And then you can brew the ephedrine into poison potions to get pure ephedrine
You get it by (smelting?) ephedra berries, you get them from a small grass with red bits found in savannas
GG FireBreather182, you just advanced to level 1!
where do you find that?
Just use ephedrine its way better
Meth labs in savanas
where do get it then?
no
Can you make methylamine?
Found anywhere in the ocean (image from wiki)
you gotta break either cocoa pods or jungle leaves. I can‚Äôt remember which.

works for me
i forgot JED existed, it definitely is a useful resource

I recommend JED for this mod
I uploaded to my server and it works great
no problem
alrighty dope thank you
you can also use red phosphorus which is equally rare
so it seems it spawns between 11 and 72 but iv only found about 3 so im not super sure how rare it is
im not sure what level it spawns in let me check
i havent found a single ore of it in multiple caves
also is lithium rare
only in savannahs iirc
savannah biomes
where do i find the meth labs usually
you should refine it but yea
i dont actually know about much content
im a friend of Jon's that occasionally helps with porting code to newer MC versions
dunno. i dont work on JEDZ lol
so i use lithium and methylamine ? <@417794810284474378>
oh i see the meth is different now
(JEI can currently show you recipes made in a crafting table but nothing past that without special integration in JEDZ, which doesnt exist yet)
you pour the sluge to a pan hit it with a stick then click it with a baggi
yea theres no integration
theres no recipe for it
blue meth bag
what are you making?
im on 1.19.2 and half the JEI recipes dont work

Where I can find the crafting recipes?
Hi
Jon might be able to explain more, if its supposed to do more than that

I think you get it by putting ephedra berries in a furnace, and iirc
You can get pure ephedrine by adding ephedrine to poison potions in a brewing stand
Five dried coca leaves, a baggie, and gasoline.

Gasoline goes in lower left
Baggie goes in top right
Fill the middle row and the rest of the top with the coca leaves
Put a syringe in a crafting table with a poppy flower

The ephedrine plants are similar to grass but are a lighter green with red berries and you need a golden shovel to get the roots fro them to replant them
Methalyme is found in meth labs which are grey stone brick buildings located in Savannah biomes, ephedrine is also found in Savannah biomes, it can be combined with potions of poison to create pure ephedrine
Or where to find Ephedra berries ?
